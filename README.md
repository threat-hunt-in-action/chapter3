# Chapter 3 - Your First Threat Hunting expedition

This chapter covers
- How to prepare for your first threat hunting expedition
- Conduct your first threat hunting expedition
- Explore the use of Sysmon
- Explore techniques and tools used to conduct a hunt
- Practice the threat hunting process, focusing on the execution phase


It is time to conduct our first threat hunting expedition. In this chapter, you get the chance to practice the knowledge gained from chapter 2 on how to create a good threat hunting play and formulate a threat hunt hypothesis. We start with a scenario that will typically trigger the threat hunting process.
We practice creating a threat hunt play and running a hunting expedition to prove the hypothesis. We then demonstrate with examples how to use Sysmon as a data source for threat hunting and how to search events in a data store to uncover clues and evidence and build your threat execution timeline.
After concluding the expedition, we map the hunting activities performed to the three phases of the threat hunting process: preparation, execution, and communication.
Finally, we provide an overview of Sysmon, one of the richest Windows data sources for the security monitoring team and threat hunters.
Let us start our first hunting expedition by describing the threat scenario.
